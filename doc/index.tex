\section*{Introduction}
%REESCREVER
This document describes the requirements and architecture instantiation of RefSORS (Reference Architecture for Service Oriented Robotic Systems). which is a reference architecture based on Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) specifically for indoor, grounded mobile robotic system. The instantiated architecture will be designed following the ArchSORS process. The resulting system will be a System-of-Systems composed by multiple robots transporting products on predetermined grid with guide lines dynamically recalcalculating the best path to navigate the industrial shop floor.

\subsection*{Objective}
The objective of the robotic system is to transport products on an industrial shop floor from a determined area to another. There will be multiple robots on the industrial shop floor, thus they will have to communictae to navigate effectively without collisions.
